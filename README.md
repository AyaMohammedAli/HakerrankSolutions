Task 1:In Python, a string can be split on a delimiter.

Example:

>>> a = "this is a string"
>>> a = a.split(" ") # a is converted to a list of strings. 
>>> print a
['this', 'is', 'a', 'string']
Joining a string is simple:

>>> a = "-".join(a)
>>> print a
this-is-a-string 
Task
You are given a string. Split the string on a " " (space) delimiter and join using a - hyphen.

Function Description

Complete the split_and_join function in the editor below.

split_and_join has the following parameters:

string line: a string of space-separated words
Returns

string: the resulting string
Input Format
The one line contains a string consisting of space separated words.

# Task 2:

We have seen that lists are mutable (they can be changed), and tuples are immutable (they cannot be changed).

Let's try to understand this with an example.

You are given an immutable string, and you want to make changes to it.

Example

>>> string = "abracadabra"
You can access an index by:

>>> print string[5]
a
What if you would like to assign a value?

>>> string[5] = 'k' 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment
How would you approach this?

One solution is to convert the string to a list and then change the value.
Example

>>> string = "abracadabra"
>>> l = list(string)
>>> l[5] = 'k'
>>> string = ''.join(l)
>>> print string
abrackdabra
Another approach is to slice the string and join it back.
Example

>>> string = string[:5] + "k" + string[6:]
>>> print string
abrackdabra
Task
Read a given string, change the character at a given index and then print the modified string.
Function Description

Complete the mutate_string function in the editor below.

mutate_string has the following parameters:

string string: the string to change
int position: the index to insert the character at
string character: the character to insert
Returns

string: the altered string
Input Format

The first line contains a string, .
The next line contains an integer , the index location and a string , separated by a space.

Sample Input

STDIN           Function
-----           --------

5 k             position = 5, character = 'k'
Sample Output

abrackdabra

Sample Input

print_full_name has the following parameters:

string first: the first name
string last: the last name
Prints

string: 'Hello  ! You just delved into python' where  and  are replaced with  and .
